              Altai is one of the most beautiful places in Russia. Primarily
              because of Mountains: if you drive along the ridge, you will see
              slopes strewn with pine trees, mountain rivers and lakes. And if
              you open it in the car windows, you can get acquainted with the
              invisible wonder of these places — mountain air.
            </p>
            <p class="place__paragraph">
              The climate in Altai is temperate, so it is best to go here in
              summer. This way you will see all the diversity of the local flora
              and fauna. Through the woods Moose roam the Altai, eagles fly over
              the ridges, and graze on the plains roe deer. And the famous
              manuls are also inhabitants of the Altai Territory.

              also they know that this is the largest source of fresh water and
              one of the the most beautiful places in Russia.

              Of course, this is all true. Baikal is still an ideal place for
              skioring competitions. This is a kind of sport when a skier he
              ties himself to a motorcycle, and tries to develop the tandem as
              much as possible high speed on the ice. In March 2019 at the
              festival The Baikal Mile set a world record of 197.011 km/h.
